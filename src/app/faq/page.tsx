    question: "What is POP pilates?",
    answer:
      "POP Pilates was created by a famous YouTuber and blogger Cassey Ho, also known as Blogilates, in 2009. POP Pilates poses and moves all originate from classical Pilates and the fundamentals of breathing, core engagement and powerhouse-based movements are shared. However, the emphasis on moving to the beat of POP music is what makes POP Pilates so unique. Each 55 min. class is designed to feel more like a dance class than a typical exercise session, and the result is always super fun!",

    question: "What is pilates?",
    answer:
      "Pilates is a physical fitness system developed in the early 20th century by Joseph Pilates, after whom it was named. If practiced with consistency, pilates improves flexibility, builds strength, and develops control and endurance throughout the entire body. It emphasizes alignment, breathing, developing a strong core, and improving coordination and balance. Pilates' system allows for different exercises to be modified in range of difficulty from beginner to advanced or to any other level, and also in terms of the instructor and practitioner's specific goals and/or limitations.",

    question: "What is the difference between yoga and pilates?",
    answer:
      "Pilates: Pilates classes focus on strength, muscle toning, body control, and flexibility, with a main emphasis on core strength. It focuses on strengthening your body while avoiding the constant shortening of muscles which can occur with most weight-lifting. This results in the development of long, lean muscles without added bulk. Yoga: Yoga focuses on flexibility and broad muscle groups. It aims to improve balance, endurance, strength and spirituality, along with some really physical movement. Classes can range from feeling gentle and nourishing to challenging and sweaty.",
